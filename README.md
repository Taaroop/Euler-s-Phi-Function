# Euler-s-Phi-Function
# This is a graphing program of Euler's Phi, or Totient function.
# The functions are defined seperately, so you can iterate over other interseting aspects using the functions
# For a natural number n, is set S is defined as S = {x: x ∈ N, x < n, and gcd(n, x) = 1}, then n(S) = Φ(n)
# For any prime number, all the numbers before it are coprime to it (from the definition of prime numbers). So, Φ(prime) = prime-1. This effect can be seen as the top straight line (y = x-1) of the graph, which is formed by the phi of prime numbers.
